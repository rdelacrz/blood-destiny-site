# Blood Destiny Site
This is the codebase for the Blood Destiny website, which will be used to advertise the Blood Destiny visual novel. The website is built on the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) JavaScript framework, utilizes [Server-Side Rendering](https://ssr.vuejs.org/), and is built using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

## Project setup
First, make sure that the latest version of Node.js is installed. It can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Afterwards, go to the directory root, and run the following command to install all project dependencies contained within the package.json folder. They will be placed within the node_modules folder, which is auto-generated by Node.
```
npm install
```

### Compile and run in development mode
To compile and run the website locally during development, run the following command below. In development mode, the website uses hot-reloading to automatically update webpages whenever a file is updated.
```
npm run dev
```

### Compile and minify for production
To build the website for production, run the following command below. All files will be minified and optimized for production-mode and exported into the dist folder.
```
npm run build
```
