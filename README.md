# Blood Destiny Site
This is the codebase for the Blood Destiny website, which will be used to advertise the Blood Destiny visual novel. The website is built on the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) JavaScript framework, utilizes [Server-Side Rendering](https://ssr.vuejs.org/), and is built on the [Vike](https://vike.dev/) plugin.

## Project setup
First, make sure that the latest version of Node.js is installed. It can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Next, install yarn, which will be used for managing packages from this point forward.
```
npm install --global yarn
```

Afterwards, go to the directory root, and run the following command to install all project dependencies contained within the package.json folder. They will be placed within the node_modules folder, which is auto-generated by Node.
```
yarn install
```

### Compile and run in development mode
To compile and run the website locally during development, run the following command below. In development mode, the website uses hot-reloading to automatically update webpages whenever a file is updated.
```
yarn dev
```

### Compile and minify for production
To build the website for production, run the following command below. All files will be minified and optimized for production-mode and exported into the dist folder. Note that Vercel will automatically run this command once the codebase has been updated on Git and synced with Vercel.
```
yarn vercel-build
```
