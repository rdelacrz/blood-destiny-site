# Blood Destiny Site
This is the codebase for the Blood Destiny website, which will be used to advertise the Blood Destiny visual novel. The website is built on the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) JavaScript framework and utilizes [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/);

## Project setup
First, make sure that version 18 of Node.js is installed. It can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Then, install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) by running the following command:
```
npm install -g yarn
```

Afterwards, go to the directory root, and run the following command to install all project dependencies contained within the package.json folder. They will be placed within the node_modules folder, which is auto-generated by Node.
```
yarn
```

### Compile and run in development mode
To compile and run the website locally during development, run the following command below. In development mode, the website uses hot-reloading to automatically update webpages whenever a file is updated.
```
yarn dev
```

### Compile and minify for production
To build the website for production, run the following command below. All files will be minified and optimized for production-mode and exported into the dist folder.
```
yarn build
```
